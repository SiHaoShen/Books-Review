## Deep Work Book Review

### 1. Idea:

*Definition of Deep Work*: Focus on professional activities in a non-interfering state, so that people's cognitive ability reaches the limit. This ability can create new value, improve skills, and is difficult to replicate.

*Definition of Shallow Work*: Transactional work that does not require high cognition is often implemented under interference. Such work usually does not create much new value for the world and is easy to copy.

- **In-depth work creates a sense of accomplishment:**
  The ability to work in depth is decreasing, and at almost the same time, its value in the social economy is also increasing. Therefore, people who can develop this skill and internalize it as the core of work life will succeed.
- In this modern era, there are three kinds of people who will not be replaced by machines, and will become stronger. 
  1. *Senior technical workers* who are good at using intelligent machines, including engineers and statistical experts.
  2. *Superstars Superstars* in various industries can use information tools to expand their influence and eliminate time and space barriers to work. 
  3. An owner who has capital to invest in new technology and promote major reorganization

- **Knowledge workers need two core competencies:**
  Ordinary people without money can only work hard to become the first two, learn to use smart machines for creative work, and become a leader in their field. To this end, two core competencies must be cultivated:
  1. The ability to quickly grasp complex tools to guide the era of major reorganization of intelligent machines, which is a very complex task, and it is difficult to understand and master.
  2. The ability to reach the elite level in terms of work quality and speed. Both core abilities depend on the ability to work in depth. Learning is an act of deep work. In-depth work is similar to deliberate practice.
- **Deep work is rare:**
  Professions fall into the misunderstanding of Busyness as Proxy for Productivity.
  At work, when there are no clear indicators of production capacity and value, many knowledge workers will use the indicators of industrial age on production capacity to accomplish many things in a visual way. Knowledge workers increasingly appear to be visually busy because they have no better way to prove their worth.
  - In-depth work is definitely a good thing for individuals, but not necessarily a good thing for companies. Some companies just want to use knowledge workers as tools (it can be replaced by advaned robots in the future).
- **Deep work is meaningful:**
  Deep work brings better spiritual experience. Your world is the product of what you care about. From this, you can think about what kind of spiritual world you construct when you put in a lot of time in a state of deep effort. Deep work will bring a flow experience.
- **Deep work gives meaning and value to work:**
  Deep work is an expression of "ingenuity" (craftsman spirit). The Enlightenment broke down the status of God, and humanism brought nihilism, which forget and underestimate the value of deep work once gave to our society. Craftsmen precious the value and meaning to things through specialization and creation.

### 2. Rule:

- **Working Mode in Deep work:**
  There are four main philosophies of different working mode in Deep work:
  1. **Monastic Philosophy:**
     Mainly those who pursue great goals, basically shield all superficial work and focus on deep work. Obviously, this is a very small number of people.
  2. **Bimodal Philosophy:**
     Combine deep work and superficial shallow work in units of months, weeks, and days.
  3. **Rhythmic Philosophy:**
     Split the combination by hour
  4. **Journalistic Philosophy:**
     With firm belief and outstanding ability, that he can switch deep work anytime and anywhere.
- **Invest on creating a personalized, deep workspace:**
  David Dewane proposed the concept of Eudaimonia Machine, which is to create an environment in which users can achieve a deep state of human prosperity, that is, achieve results that reach the limit of personal ability.
- **Guaranteed Working Hours:**
  Deep work requires you to respect your time. The quality of deep working hours are higher than quantity working hours.
  There is an upper limit for each person's deep working time. No one can work deeply all day long. The author believes that deep work is similar to deliberate practice. It is not bad for a master to have four hours a day.
  There is also a special case, namely the "Roosevelt Sprint", that is, the exam is imminent, and the last few days before the exam are deep work, under high pressure, output-oriented, and extremely efficient.
  A relaxed and comfortable environment is conducive to the release of creativity and gain insights. Even walking outdoors in the ice and snow will also be conducive to the recovery of energy.
  Sufficient time must be allocated to restore energy. Do not work overtime at night and do sleep well to lay the foundation for the next day's deep work.
- **Set the length of daily deep work and make an assessment:**
  According to The 4 Disciplines of Executiona, you need to set principles for deep work:
  1. **Clear goals:**
     Choose a few high-yield tasks as the goals of deep work. The focus is on extremely important things. Having a clear goal can bring tangible career benefits, and it can also bring more stable enthusiasm. For example: in the next academic year, publish 5 high-quality peer-reviewed papers.
  2. **Set few goals**
  3. **The return should be high and also set indicators**
     Use the length of deep work time as an indicator to evaluate your performance. Use "leading indicators" instead of "lagging indicators" to evaluate the effectiveness of your work. 
     For example, "number of published papers" is a lagging indicator, which is the result of deep work, not the in-depth work itself; "deep work duration" is a leading indicator, which will affect the result of "number of published papers" rather than more Easy to monitor and evaluate in real time.
     Review performance regularly, improve programs, and improve plans.
  4. **Track progress:**
     Set up a scoreboard to record your deep work time in an obvious location.
- **Moderately lost contact:**
  Take offline mode and disconnect directly.
  Stay away from social media and reduce waste. For most professionals, social media is far less helpful to their goals than it hurts (waste time). 
  Many writers, such as Malcolm Gladwell, do not use Twitter because it is not economical.
  Setting up email sender filtering and make yourself difficult to contact.
- **Develop good habits:**
  Get accustomed as much as possible to reduce attention loss during deep work
  1. Regularization: The tools are placed in a specific order, making the behavior highly automated.
  2. Convenience: Prepare a variety of coffee, tea, and desserts in advance as refreshing things to keep the brain running at a high level.
- **Collaborative Deep Work:**
  Email can also be a collaborative in deep work, provided that you need to write about:
  - In-depth issues and problems
  - According to the law of college students, find out topics worthy of deep participation
  - Deep reply
  - Speak clearly all at once and avoid long talks
  - Lead and give a "closed" frame
- **Strengthen concentration training:**
  Understanding "fragmented time and survival"
  In the era of network tools, the shallow working hours of knowledge workers have increased, resulting in damage to their deep work ability. If you have to find your phone to pass the time in line, your brain will be reorganized.
  Frequent multitasking switching can cause mental disability.
  1. Active cutting:
     Instead of passively entering the distraction mode, it is better to actively master the distraction rhythm and set a special time period to handle chores. Draw a block of "online time", in addition to "offline time".
  2. Tolerate offline:
     completely avoid using the Internet during "offline time". If you currently have a plan to ban Internet use for 30 minutes, and then start to feel bored and eager for entertainment, then the next 30 minutes of confrontation will become a phased exercise of concentration. The author believes that you will get used to it slowly.
- **There are two points to note here:**
  Be careful of being distracted and spinning around. The brain may think of a lot of irrelevant but more interesting ideas. We can't be led by our thoughts, we must grasp the direction. At the same time, the brain may avoid the difficulties that need to use the brain, spin around where it is easy, and think deeply.
  Organize your deep thinking. Deep thinking has a certain structure, not just thinking about it. For example, from asking questions, finding possible answers, then testing the answers, and putting them into practice.
- **Train your memory and concentration:**
  Train your concentration by learning how to remember a deck of cards.
- **Tool selection:**
  Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Only when the actual benefits of a tool to these factors outweigh the actual harms, this tool is chosen.
- **There are more and more useless things in life:**
  The easiest way is to throw away the useless things.
  Two questions you should ask about those things:
  1. If I have been using this service, will my life be better in the past 30 days? 
  2. Do people care if I am using this service? If the answer to these two questions is "No", then it should be quit forever.

- **Fixed schedule productivity:**
  1. **Define detailed plans:**
     With hours as the unit, arrange specific plans in advance, including the time and space blocks of deep work every day.
  2. **Deep work first:**
     Strive for more than 4 hours of deep work. Once in the state, all other affairs give way to deep work. For deep  work, it is better to modify the plan more than ten times a day.
  3. **Leave redundancy:**
     Each task is left with redundant time. After the deep work is completed, this time becomes a reward for shallow tasks.
  4. **Save and archive:**
     Come to a "stop working ceremony" before get off work, in order to sort out, summarize, and archive all clues you worked on today.
  5. **Rest at night:**
     No deep work at night
